We're excited to introduce **NitroPerf** — a hybrid performance monitor for React Native powered by Nitro Modules.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why NitroPerf?

React Native developers need fast, reliable performance monitoring that doesn't interfere with the metrics it's measuring. NitroPerf achieves this through:

- **Synchronous JSI calls** via Nitro Modules — zero bridge overhead
- **Native frame tracking** using CADisplayLink (iOS) and Choreographer (Android)
- **Stutter detection** that identifies real user-visible performance issues

## Three Ways to Monitor

1. **On-device overlay** — drop in `<PerfOverlay />` for instant visibility
2. **React hook** — `usePerfMetrics()` for custom UI or logging
3. **DevTools panel** — rich browser-based charts via Rozenite

## Get Started

```bash
npm install @nitroperf/core react-native-nitro-modules
```
